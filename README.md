# Apple Authentication for React Native

---

**:warning: THIS REPO IS ARCHIVED :warning:**

Development of this package will not continue.

If you're looking for apple sign in for react native, check out the Expo [implementation](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/master/packages/expo-apple-authentication/README.md) which supports also bare react native projects.

The implementation depends on [unimodules](https://blog.expo.io/you-can-now-use-expo-apis-in-any-react-native-app-7c3a93041331) which are a way to use Expo apis in any RN project.
